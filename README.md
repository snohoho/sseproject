Secure Software Engineering project to help identify and remain vigilant against threats in the mobile device security space.

This software will provide a random series of questions related to the topic of mobile device security. 
The questions and their correct answers contain important information that is vital to understanding how to stay secure. 
It will keep track of the correct answers in the session. 
The goal is to make users more aware of mobile security so that whether they are developers or just users, they can be safer.

Question View Mode: 
The user can view and memorize the questions and their correct answers before or after they take the quiz.

Test Mode: 
The user is shown a game screen and uses the WASD keys on the keyboard to move a game character around. 
When walking into a monster, a question will be asked and the user can submit an answer from the choices displayed. 
Upon being correct, the user is shown they are correct by killing the monster and removing it from the game world, and upon an incorrect answer, the monster remains alive and the user loses HP. 
If the user loses all their HP, the player dies and the test ends immediately. 
There are potions scattered across the world that allow the player to restore their HP.
